This is the learning recorde of the git and github
1. For comparison the difference between two versions of a file, use diff command in Linux/Unix OS and FC command in Windows

2. This is the second time I change this file, for reflection of the version control. Since we can efficiently find out the difference between current version and historical version of a file, we can modify it easily

3. git log show the changes that commited to the file
   git log --stat: give how many changes to the file

4. git diff ID1 ID2: comparing the two changes

5. A commit should corresponding to a logical change which will make the log easy to read. 
   A commit will track all file in the repository and record the changes happen to them.

6. git checkout ID: make the file as the version of that ID so that we can trace back where changes happen

7. git repository also store metadata about the history of the repository and stalled in hidden directory

8. when initialize a git repository, there is no commmit which can be proved useing 'git log' after 'git init'.

9. Staging area allows us to add files that we want to commit the change which gives us more control of what we want to do with our files

10. 'git status' will show what have been added to staging and what are left untracking
